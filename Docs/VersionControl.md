# Source Code Version Control Tools

## Introduction
Version control is a crucial aspect of software development, enabling teams to manage changes to their codebase efficiently. It helps maintain the integrity of the project, preserves the history of modifications, and facilitates collaboration among team members.

## Version Control System Used
For this project, we have chosen Git as our version control system (VCS). Git was selected due to its widespread adoption, robust featureset, and excellent support for distributed development workflows.

## Repository Setup
### Structure
Our repository follows a feature branch workflow, where each feature or bug fix is developed in a dedicated branch before being merged into the main branch. The directory layout is organized logically, with separate folders for source code, documentation, and configuration files.

### Integration with DevContainer and CI/CD Pipeline
The repository is integrated with our development environment using DevContainers, ensuring consistency across team members' development environments. Additionally, we have set up a CI/CD pipeline that automatically runs tests and deploys changes to our staging environment upon successful builds.

### Standards and Conventions
We adhere to the Git Flow branching model, with branches named according to their purpose (e.g., feature/feature-name, bugfix/bug-name). Commit messages follow the conventional commit format to provide clarity and context for each change.

## Common Commands and Usage
- `git clone <repository-url>`: Clone the repository to your local machine.
- `git add .`: Stage all changes for commit.
- `git commit -m "Your commit message here"`: Commit staged changes with a descriptive message.
- `git pull origin main`: Pull the latest changes from the remote repository.
- `git push origin main`: Push local commits to the remote repository.

## Collaboration Features
Git facilitates collaboration through features such as:
- Pull Requests: Propose and review changes before merging them into the main branch.
- Code Reviews: Discuss and provide feedback on code changes within pull requests.
- Conflict Resolution: Resolve conflicts that arise when merging branches with overlapping changes.

## Challenges and Solutions
Throughout the project, we encountered challenges such as merge conflicts and diverging feature branches. These were addressed through proactive communication, regular code reviews, and the use of Git's conflict resolution tools.

## Conclusion
The adoption of Git as our version control system has greatly enhanced our development workflow. It has provided us with a robust framework for managing code changes, collaborating effectively, and ensuring the integrity of our project. Moving forward, we will continue to leverage Git's capabilities to streamline our development process and deliver high-quality software.
