# DevContainer Environment

## Introduction 
A Development Container (DevContainer) serves as the backbone of a consistent and reproducible development environment. It ensures that all team members work with the same dependencies, tools, and configurations. In the context of Flutter application development, the DevContainer streamlines the setup process and fosters collaboration.

## Configuration
For my Flutter development environment, I selected a Docker image explicitly designed for Flutter. This image includes the Flutter SDK, Dart, and other essential dependencies.

## Base Image
